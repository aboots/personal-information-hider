# personal Information Hider

This project introduces a Python package that serves as a Personal Information Concealer. It takes a text file as input identifies and removes personal information such as first and last names, addresses, URLs, email addresses, company names, dates, and more. The cleaned text is then written back into a file. This tool is particularly useful for addressing privacy and security concerns in various contexts. The concealment process leverages techniques such as web crawling, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and regular expressions to ensure thorough and accurate information hiding. The combination of POS tagging and regex-based solutions forms the core of this privacy tool.
