# personal_info_hider

An application (can be used as a python package) that can take a text file as input and hide personal information from the text and write it back
in a file. It can remove first and last names, addresses, URLs, email addresses, company names, dates, and many other things. This
may be used in many places for privacy and security issues. For this project, we do a lot of crawling or use part of speech analyses and
regular expressions and other things
